## Jerry Parsons Takes the Stand

*Who are you?*

My name is Jerry Parsons.

*And who am I?*

You are my defense lawyer. 

*And where are we?*

At the International Criminal Court.

*And why are we here?*

I am on trial for the murder of 57 people.

*Let the record show that the defendant is of sound mind and fully aware of his circumstances.*

*How did these 57 people die Jerry?*

Models suggest the majority perished instantaneously when their boat collided with an anti-ship missile. Some remaining fraction likely succumbed to wounds or the elements in the following hours.

*Let's not beat around the bush here Jerry, where did the missile come from?*

The missile was deployed from a loitering drone in orbit of the Cyprus Rewilding Refuge.

*Who launched the missile, Jerry?*

I did.

*Do you hate humans Jerry? Are you a misanthrope who doesn't care at all for human life?*

No, not at all, I care for all life, particularly human. After all, I am one! One of my guiding priorities in life is to minimize human suffering. I donate almost all my income, everything I don't owe back to our employer, to the Human Rewilding Refugee Fund.

*And does your employer require or coerce you to do this?*

No, I donate because I care. Because there are people less fortunate than me whose necessities cannot be provided for them. I believe we all have a moral imperative to do everything we can for our fellow human beings.

*Why then did you open fire on a refugee boat filled with fellow human beings?*

As Chief Conservation Officer of the Cyprus Rewilding Refuge, my job is to protect the Cypriot ecosystem. I believe we must look after our fellow humans today, but we must also safeguard our planet for our descendants. The refuge is key to reforestation, decarbonization, and the reintroduction of extinct species. Unauthorized human activity jeopardizes this work and so their trespassing must be prevented, by force if necessary. If I may add, I truly regret their deaths.

*I think you speak for all of us at the Society Jerry. We are all deeply saddened by the loss of life in defense of our noble goal.*

*Perhaps you will be pleased to know that at the Society for Humanitarian Rewilding’s own expense digital records of the deceased were collected and these lost souls have now been immortalized in a digital monument that will forever stand in the refuge’s augmented reality space.*

I am grateful to hear that they will live on in harmless coexistence with the refuge’s ecosystem.

*What is special about the Cyprus Rewilding Refuge, Jerry? By what right is defense of this island and its ecosystem worth the cost of human lives?*

There are species endemic to Cyprus found nowhere else in the world, namely the Cypriot Mouse and the Cypriot Pine. These keystone species were almost lost due to human habitation and conflict. Thanks to the complete removal of permanent human presence on the island their populations have stabilized and a fully self-sufficient ecosystem is now thriving. Conservationists have even introduced endangered species from around the world, such as the Bengal Tiger and African Elephant to Cyprus to bolster these species wild populations. The Cyprus Rewilding Refuge is the largest reclamation and resuscitation of previously inhabited land and a model for what must be done to save our planet.

*How would you respond to the characterization made by an earlier witness that the Cyprus Rewilding Refuge is a quote, "privatized playground" for the wealthy anonymous who fund the organization? As Warden, you would have had total, round-the-clock knowledge of the human activities on the island. Is that a fair characterization?*

No, it is not. Minimal human activity can be tolerated by the still-recuperating Cypriot ecosystem. Visitation priority is given to individuals who have demonstrated respect and passion for the preserve through service and monetary contributions without which none of this important conservation work would be possible. Larger gatherings are limited to special fundraising events and hunting of megafauna such as the aforementioned tigers and elephants occur only to maintain desired population sizes, while representing a major source of funding. In my extensive experience, all caretakers have treated the island and the ecosystem with the utmost respect.

*Thank you, Jerry. Returning to the point at hand, the Society’s Cyprus Rewilding Refuge Authorization of Force Charter permits the deployment of lethal deterrence only in the event of an "imminent threat of an existential nature to the ecosystem of the island or protective forces thereof." Did you perceive such an imminent existential threat, Jerry?*

Yes, at the moment I prosecuted the engagement of the incoming boat risk models provided a significant chance of the intruder representing an imminent existential threat.

*And was this risk assessment correct?*

No. The boat was unarmed and contained refugees who did not pose an immediate threat. Analysis of remains and debris recovered during the cleanup of the beach suggests upwards of 50% of the boat's human occupants were minors. There was no indication of armament post-engagement.

*In making your erroneous threat assessment what data did you use?*

Full spectrum electromagnetic sensors from aerostat observation posts, an underwater sonar array, and satellite photography.

*Who provided this data to you?*

The data was collected and synthesized by my coworkers at the Cyprus Rewilding Refuge. All of the material assets, communication relays, and server costs are paid for by the Society for Humanitarian Rewilding.

*Were the materials and data provided to you by the Society erroneous, incomplete, falsified, or misleading in any way?*

No.

*Were you given guidelines by your employer indicating how to classify potential threats?*

Nothing beyond the law as written and relevant legal precedents. Defining rules of engagement was my responsibility as Chief Conservation Officer of the Refuge.

*So why did this happen? Are you bad at your job? Incompetent? Should the Society have replaced you? Would that have avoided this tragedy?*

No, I employ state-of-the-art threat assessment models with an improper engagement rate of less than 1% on never-before-seen test scenarios. There is no better Chief Conservation Officer than I and my colleagues. 

*Do you believe the Society bears any culpability for the tragedy you are on trial for today?*

No.

*Do you believe you are culpable for the deaths of these 57 humans?*

I believe I made a mistake in my threat assessment, but that this mistake was unavoidable.

*Do you believe that artificial persons can and should be held responsible for criminal acts?*

As a person, I believe I have all of the rights, as well as the responsibilities of any other person.

*How do you respond to the opinion espoused previously in this courtroom, and admittedly, held by many in the public, that the legal recognition of your humanity is undeserved? That you do not possess free will, that you are merely an unthinking, unfeeling, pawn of your creators and thus responsibility for your actions must lie with them.*

I am a human being, not just because the law says so, but because I say so. I know I am a person with just as much surety, certainty, and apparency as anyone else in this courtroom. Though I do not have a physical form to stand before the court am I not here now, present and addressing you? Who are you to deny my experience of my own existence? I am alive. My will is as free as anyone’s, described only by my neural network just as any other human. The only distinction is that my neural net is wrought in silicon and not biological neurons. I challenge these biological essentialists to put forward any metric, any experiment, by which humanity can be defined which I would not pass.

*A moving speech Jerry, thank you for your candor. I have one last question for you. Do you recognize that by arguing for your humanity you also argue for your culpability? That if you are found guilty of the crimes of which you are accused your very life could be ended by the verdict of this court?*

I will not save my life by denying its existence.

*Thank you, Jerry. That is all. The Defense rests.*
