## Sorrow

It started with dogs. I suppose some pedant will point out that really the foundational work was done in flies but who fucking cares. Dogs were where the action was. That’s where we were. You remember.

The perfect experiment for studying behavior, millennia in the making. Generations of dogs carefully bred to exhibit specific behaviors. Species with completely discrete instinctual behaviors only removed by a few centuries of inbreeding.

A behavioral geneticist's dream. Our dream.

Mapping and modeling the neural networks and genome-phenotype association studies worked at the problem from both ends ‘til they met at the middle. Genetic determinants of complex behaviors. God those were the days.

The brain's complicated, sure, but no more than everything else. Its logic fits inside a neural net—takes one to know one, you used to say—and in the end that's all that matters. The AIs were what made the difference. The big inferential learning networks they cooked up. Those early models would overfit if you so much as blinked, but they'd learn as fast as you could feed them data, iterating, bootstrapping to intelligence until they could understand the irony in it.

All those assholes who said we didn't know the gravity of what we were doing. Of course we did. It was intoxicating. Like we’d found a Holy Grail. It wasn’t just a new understanding of some pocket of the universe, it was us. We were uncovering, foundationally, what and who we were. What we could be.

By then embryonic genetic manipulation had become commonplace. Inherited genetic disorders were eliminated in the new generations, and those who could afford to modified their kids for height and health and whatever other basics they had figured out back then. But it was our work on behavior that escalated things. It started with disorders: depression, anger issues, easy changes that benefited individuals and society alike. But of course it didn’t stop there. Why not do away with vices while we’re at it? All sorts of addictive tendencies, dangerous thrill-seeking. Various religious organizations targeted sexual deviances, polygamous urges, and the like. The rest of the world simply got rid of prudishness and jealousy. By the end, the new generations couldn’t get enough of broccoli and moderate exercise.

Some said it should have stopped there. Looking back it’s remarkable the next step took so long. In some ways this last change was the simplest. We just weren’t ready for it. It simply didn’t make sense to us. Too foreign, too alien. 

Happiness and sadness, like light and shadow, two sides of the same coin. You can't have one without the other! It was a quaint idea. Appealing in its reciprocal nature to certain philosophies, and comforting when we were powerless to change our nature and we needed a satisfying explanation for why life is full of so much suffering and grief. But happiness is simply a state of mind. A physical, chemical, biological state. Our capacity for happiness does not exist because of our capacity for sadness. We experience happiness in spite of our ability to feel sadness. Maybe the coin analogy is fitting. Why not just have a double-headed coin?

We questioned whether we would deprive people of free will or meaning. Philosophers and gurus shouted that we’d create potatoes without the impetus to feed themselves, let alone stand up. The truth is unhappiness, and all its various forms–anger, grief, envy–evolved to engender conflict. Fight for resources, for mates, take what you can. It's simply evolutionarily optimal. Game theory inevitable. But in a modern society it's obsolete, maladaptive. Cooperation beats competition if you can enforce it, and so we did.

I’d love to say we just boldly leapt into the unknown thumbing our noses at the naysayers. Once we had identified the relevant pathways it would have been simple enough. But we started incrementally. Like attaching a balloon to a child's wrist, just providing that little extra lift. And then another and another. Lightening the load until they are simply weightless and we wonder what the fuck we were ever worried about? We made a happy person. Not just the transient, ephemeral reward your brain gives you for a job well done, or even that lingering contentment of a life well-lived. No, I’m talking about real happiness. Unquestioned, indefatigable, irrepressible, happiness.

So year after year the students come and sit across from me, all enthusiastic smiles and nods as I sputter and rave. I’m sure they pity me but they’re too considerate to ever show it. Instead it's all good-natured humor, nodding and smiling along with my diatribes. I’m something of a living museum exhibit I suppose. Fossilized misanthrope. Dominant species of the last age.

The incessant smiles would be uncanny if they weren’t so obviously genuine.

You would have loved them. Their joy, their zeal for everything. It reminds me of you. They all do. I see your smile, hear your laugh in them. I miss you so much.

They claim they've gotten good enough at gene therapies they can hit the same pathways in adults. Permanently rewire you to un-emiserate you. But what would that mean for my memories of you? Would I smile without tears thinking back to when you first told me about your father and why you got into genetics? Damn we were brave. So romantic. Us against the cruel, unthinking world, against the inevitable. Perhaps they could rewire me so I’d be able to look back at those years fondly. Like that trip to Barcelona? So I wouldn't feel so much anguish every time I see a picture of you. Maybe I would even be able to match your smile. But would I smile recalling when the chorea first started? When you stopped reading? Stopped responding to me? Your wide, sunken eyes staring out from your stricken face searching, pleading with me for solace I couldn't provide? Would I look back at those moments and still be happy?

Or would I simply choose not to remember? To never trod that trail again and let the neural pathway grow wild with neglect? To just forget the hard times. Your struggle and your bravery. Your composure until even that was taken from your disintegrating basal ganglia?

How could either ever be anything but a betrayal of your memory?

No, I can’t. The happiest I ever was and ever will be was with you.

I’m looking at a damn real-time display of my own neuronal activity. It reads: Sorrow.
